# TODO for Donate Page Layout Update

- [x] Modify DonationPage.jsx layout to use flexbox with two columns (left for image and text, right for form)
- [x] Add image (/Hero.avif) in the left column
- [x] Add text below the image: Church name "Church", email "info@church.org", phone "+1 234 567 890", additional text "Support our mission"
- [x] Ensure the form is positioned in the right column
